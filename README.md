# Hyperbolidal Carter-Penrose diagrams
by Alex Vano-Vinuales, October 2023. 

This repository contains tools and some data to create conformal Carter-Penrose diagrams, especially oriented to the representation of hyperboloidal slices in the Schwazschild geometry. It provides supplementary material to paper [arXiv: 23XX.XXXXX [gr-qc]](website). 

The contained material is the following: 
* Mathematica notebook to create the diagrams. 
* Zipped data (required for some plots) in folder *data*. Please unzip before evaluating the Mathematica notebook. 
* Gif animations of dynamical spacetimes in folder *gifs*.

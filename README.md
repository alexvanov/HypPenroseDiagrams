# Hyperboloidal Carter-Penrose diagrams
by Alex Vano-Vinuales, October 2023. 

This repository contains tools and some data to create conformal Carter-Penrose diagrams, especially oriented to the representation of hyperboloidal slices in the Schwarzschild geometry. It provides supplementary material for paper [arXiv: 2311.04972 [gr-qc]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04972) published open-access in [Class.Quant.Grav. 41 (2024) 105003](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/ad3aca). 

The contained material is the following: 
* Mathematica notebook to create the diagrams. 
* Compressed data (required for some plots) in folder *data*. Please unzip before evaluating the Mathematica notebook. 
* Gif animations of dynamical spacetimes in folder *gifs*.
